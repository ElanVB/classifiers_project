# A Project About Classifiers
This project should introduce you to, and teach you how to use, three different classifiers.
You will see how each classifier performs on the given task and gain some insight into when each classifier is best used and why.

## Project set-up

1. First you will need to fork this repository (hopefully you have already done that)
2. Install dependencies: this can be done easily with [Anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html). Simply download and run the "Anaconda-latest-....sh" file. After this you should have Python and all the packages we need.
3. Run the `.ipynb` file that corresponds to the piece of the project you want to work on (`jupyter notebook Binary_Logistic_Regression.ipynb`, for example).

## Task
We will be building classifiers that aim to detect what numerical digit is written on an image.
First we will build and test our models on ["The Digit Dataset"](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_digits_last_image.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-datasets-plot-digits-last-image-py) and then (if we have time) we will do the same for the [MNIST Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database#/media/File:MnistExamples.png).

Run the `Digit.ipynb` file now and have a look at the data.

## Classifier Models
### Binary Logistic Regression
### Multi-class Logistic Regression
### Fully-connected Feed-forward Neural Network
### Convolutional Neural Network
